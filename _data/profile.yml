  <p>
    I am currently a Master's student at <a href="https://www.pku.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Peking University</a>, 
    majoring in Medical Technology within the Department of Biomedical Engineering (Cross-faculty).
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously, I obtained my B.S. degree in Intelligent Medical Engineering from 
    <a href="https://www.xidian.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Xidian University</a>, 
    where I ranked 1st in my college and received the National Scholarship.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research focuses on <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> and <strong>Autonomous Agents</strong>, 
    enhancing their <strong>reasoning</strong> and <strong>planning</strong> capabilities to make them more generalizable and effective for complex problem-solving.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, I work on <strong>AI for Science (AI4S)</strong>, developing advanced <strong>foundation models</strong> for 
    <strong>single-cell omics</strong> and physics-informed algorithms for medical imaging.
